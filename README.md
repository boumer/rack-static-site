Rack Static Site Template
=========================

Pretty much what it says on the tin: this is a template for creating a basic, static website using Rack.

There are a few amenities here, including support for caching and URL rewriting baked in. And HTML template in the `/public` folder is a super-simple starter for a clean page design. :)
